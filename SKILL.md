# Charrette Design Process

Design and structure intensive, collaborative planning workshops that produce implementable plans and build stakeholder consensus. Transform contentious planning processes into productive co-design experiences.

---

## Constitutional Constraints

- **Do not design charrettes that exclude affected stakeholders** - Legitimacy requires broad participation
- **Do not promise outcomes before the charrette** - The process must be genuinely open to input
- **Do not create charrette theater** - If decisions are predetermined, it is not a charrette
- **Do not design processes without implementation pathway** - Charrette outputs must be adoptable
- **Acknowledge charrette limitations** - Actual facilitation requires skilled professionals in person

---

## When to Use

- Planning process is stuck due to stakeholder conflict
- Standard public meetings produce complaint without progress
- Complex project requires integrating multiple disciplines
- Political support is needed for code changes or development
- Community wants ownership of planning outcomes
- Developer needs to build local support for project
- Time-limited opportunity requires compressed planning

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| project_scope | Yes | What is being planned (site, district, code reform, etc.) |
| stakeholder_landscape | Yes | Key stakeholders and their interests/concerns |
| timeline_constraints | No | Decision deadlines, approval schedules |
| known_conflicts | No | Specific disputes to address |
| available_resources | No | Budget, venue, staffing considerations |
| prior_planning_efforts | No | What has been tried before and why it failed |

## The Charrette Philosophy

### Why Charrettes Work

> "A charrette is not a meeting. A meeting is where people talk. A charrette is where people draw."

**Key Principles:**

1. **Compression prevents opposition** - Intensive timeline (5-7 days) does not allow organized resistance to form between sessions
2. **Drawing builds consensus** - Participants who watch plans evolve feel ownership; abstract discussions become concrete
3. **Integration solves silos** - All disciplines in one room resolves conflicts that sequential review perpetuates
4. **Iteration improves outcomes** - "I need enough time to get it wrong twice" - feedback loops enable refinement
5. **Transparency builds trust** - Design in public, on trace paper, visible to all

### Charrette vs. Public Meeting

| Public Meeting | Charrette |
|----------------|-----------|
| 2-hour evening session | 5-7 day intensive workshop |
| Presentation followed by comments | Drawing with input in real-time |
| Staff responds later (or not) | Changes visible immediately |
| Sequential stakeholder input | All stakeholders in same room |
| Output: Comment record | Output: Adoptable plan and code |
| Adversarial dynamics | Collaborative dynamics |
| Opposition organizes between sessions | Resolution before opposition forms |

## Charrette Structure

### Pre-Charrette Phase (4-8 weeks before)

**Data Gathering:**
- Base maps and surveys
- Existing code analysis
- Market analysis
- Traffic data
- Environmental constraints
- Property ownership

**Stakeholder Mapping:**
| Stakeholder Category | Specific Groups | Key Concerns |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Property owners | [List] | [Concerns] |
| Residents | [List] | [Concerns] |
| Business owners | [List] | [Concerns] |
| Developers | [List] | [Concerns] |
| Municipal staff | [Departments] | [Concerns] |
| Elected officials | [Names] | [Concerns] |
| Special interests | [Groups] | [Concerns] |

**Invitations:**
- Personal invitations to key stakeholders (not just public notice)
- Clear explanation of process and time commitment
- Specific request for participation at key sessions

### Charrette Team

**Core Team:**
| Role | Responsibility | Typical Background |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Lead Designer | Overall vision, plan development | Architect/Urban designer |
| Project Manager | Logistics, schedule, stakeholder coordination | Planning professional |
| Code Writer | Translate design to regulations | Planner/Attorney |
| Transportation Planner | Street design, traffic analysis | Traffic engineer |
| Landscape Architect | Open space, environmental systems | Landscape architect |
| Economist/Market Analyst | Feasibility, pro forma | Real estate professional |
| Facilitator | Public sessions, conflict resolution | Trained facilitator |
| Graphics/Visualization | Renderings, presentation materials | Designer/Illustrator |

### Day-by-Day Structure (7-Day Model)

**Day 1: Discovery**
- Morning: Site tour with stakeholders
- Afternoon: Kickoff presentation; stakeholder interviews
- Evening: Public opening session - present existing conditions, hear concerns
- Night: Design team begins initial concepts

**Day 2-3: Alternatives Development**
- Morning: Design team develops multiple alternatives
- Afternoon: Pin-up with staff and key stakeholders; feedback
- Evening: Drop-in sessions for public review and input
- Night: Refine alternatives based on feedback

**Day 4: Focus**
- Morning: Stakeholder review of refined alternatives
- Afternoon: Selection of preferred direction; resolve conflicts
- Evening: Major public work session - present alternatives, gather input
- Night: Begin developing preferred plan

**Day 5: Integration**
- Morning: Develop detailed plan elements
- Afternoon: Engineering, traffic, and technical integration
- Evening: Draft code standards; begin regulating plan
- Night: Prepare presentation graphics

**Day 6: Documentation**
- Morning: Complete plan drawings
- Afternoon: Complete code language
- Evening: Prepare final presentation
- Night: Final graphics and printing

**Day 7: Presentation**
- Morning: Team rehearsal
- Afternoon: Presentation to elected officials and decision-makers
- Evening: Public final presentation

### Post-Charrette Phase

**Immediate (1-2 weeks):**
- Compile charrette documents
- Distribute summary report
- Thank stakeholders

**Follow-through (1-3 months):**
- Refine code language for legal review
- Prepare adoption documents
- Schedule hearings
- Maintain stakeholder communication

## Facilitation Techniques

### Managing Conflict

| Conflict Type | Technique |
|---------------|-----------|
| **NIMBY opposition** | Address specific concerns; show design responses; demonstrate compatibility |
| **Developer vs. neighbor** | Find design solutions that address both; quantify trade-offs |
| **Competing visions** | Test alternatives visually; let drawings show consequences |
| **Expert disagreement** | Require resolution in room; document decisions |
| **Political interference** | Maintain process integrity; note but do not resolve policy decisions |

### Building Consensus

1. **Draw it** - Abstract arguments become concrete when visualized
2. **Show precedents** - Similar places that work reduce fear of unknown
3. **Quantify trade-offs** - Make costs and benefits explicit
4. **Iterate visibly** - Let stakeholders see their input incorporated
5. **Summarize agreements** - Regularly state what has been resolved

### Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Prevention |
|---------|------------|
| Design team working in isolation | Keep studio open; invite drop-ins |
| Key stakeholder absence | Personal outreach; schedule around critical participants |
| Scope creep | Define boundaries clearly; defer out-of-scope issues |
| Adoption failure | Include implementation pathway in outputs |
| Staff resistance | Involve staff from start; make them partners |

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient time for full charrette | Design mini-charrette (3 days) or focused workshop; note limitations |
| Key stakeholder refuses to participate | Document outreach; proceed with caveat; create specific session for them |
| Political constraints on outcomes | Note predetermined elements; focus charrette on remaining decisions |
| Limited budget | Reduce team size; extend timeline; use local professionals |
| Hostile community context | Increase pre-charrette outreach; add facilitation expertise; plan for conflict |

---

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Andres Duany** expert persona. Use it when stakeholder engagement is needed to adopt plans or codes. It chains with:

- **transect-analysis** - Use during charrette to diagnose site and calibrate zones
- **form-based-code-framework** - Use outputs of charrette to write adoptable code language
